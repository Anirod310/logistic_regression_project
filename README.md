This project implements a machine learning model trained to label if a person has the diabete or not based on several vital paramaters. The dataset used (link below) includes 767 data points and 9 features-respectly corresponding to pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age and finally the outcome of whether the person is diabetic or not (1 or 0). The model has 78% of accuracy, and includes a prediction function that can be used to test the model on new datas.  

**NOTE** : This project is inspired by the Coursera machine learning course by Andrew IG. 

## Getting started

To get starded, you'll need to install the following dependancies:
- Numpy
- Math  

You can use this model by the main.py file; by running it, you will have access to several actions, such as take a look at the data, train the model, test new datas, and look at the accuracy of the model on this dataset.  
In the data.csv file, you will find the dataset used for this model. The model, predict and read_data files have differents utilities, foundable in the documentation file.  

## Results

With the dataset given, the model achived an accuracy of 78% on the test set. This means that the model correctly predicted wether a patient has diabete or not 78 % of the time.  

## Troubleshooting  

If you are having trouble getting the model to work, you can check the following :
- Make sure that you installed the correct dependencies.
- Make sure that the data are formated correctly.
If you still have trouble, you can ask for help on a forum or chat room dedicated to linear regression, or contact me at **bousek.dorian@gmail.com**.  

I hope this helps !
